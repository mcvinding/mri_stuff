Various helper functions for processing MRI for MEG analysis.

So far this is only backup from piloting and/or specific helper functions from the PD project.
I will update functions to make them globally available. Functions are made to run within the NatMEG infrastructure.

Tools:
* Wrapper that run Freesurfer on raw MRI dicom and arange output according to project
* BEM models using multiecho sequences (similar mne_flash_bem) on GE scanner.
